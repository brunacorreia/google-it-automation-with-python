# Using Python to Interact with the Operating System - Week 1
This course will teach how to use Python to perform system administration tasks and interact with a computer’s operating system. For some exercises the application called Qwiklabs is going to be used in a remote Linux virtual machine.

## Course prerequisites
- The basic Python syntax (if, for, while, defining functions, classes, and methods)
- How to use the most common data structures (strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries)
- How to import and use additional Python modules

This course also requires some familiarity with some basic operating system concepts:
- Files, directories, and file systems
- Processes
- Log files

### Downloads and Imports
Windows:
- Python 3
- pip install requests> python> import requests

Installation guide for other OS: https://realpython.com/installing-python/

### Commands
python -V  
python --version

### Programming resources to study
- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: This book (available online and in print) includes a lot of practical programming exercises for beginners. You can refer to this content to read more about some of the things that we'll be discussing, and get inspired with more ideas of things that can be automated.

- Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python: This site (available online and in print) also covers a lot of what we can do with Python. Again, you can use this resource to learn more about the subjects we cover (and the ones we had to omit for time constraints).

- The official language reference: Once you know what Python tool you'll be using to do a certain task, this technical reference of all Python language components can be a great   

## Getting Ready for Python
Operating System: The software that manages everything that goes on in the computer. It reads, writes and deletes files from the hard drive.

There are two main parts in an OS: the kernel and the user space.

**- Kernel:** 
The main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our systems resources. As users, we don't interact with the kernel directly. Instead, we interact with the other part of the operating system called the user space. 
**- The User space:**
It is basically everything outside of the kernel. These are things that we interact with directly, like the system programs and user interface. 

When we say "operating system", we're referring to both the kernel and the user space. 

### Operating Systems
- Windows 
- MacOS
- Android
- FreeBSD
- Linux
    Distributions:
    - Ubuntu
    - Debian
    - Red Hat

### Python Modules
Python Modules are written and posted on  Python Package Index (PyPI) by programmers.
- pip: a command line tool used to install, update, and remove external modules on whichever operating system you're running on your computer. It's considered the main Python package manager. 

## Running Python Locally
